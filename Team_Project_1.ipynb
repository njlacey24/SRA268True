What is interesting is that there is more snow in the spring in state college than there is in the fall, when it is usually seen as colder.  This can be noted in the amount of snow seen in March and April, as opposed to only in November, the only fall month to see snow."

        "This graph is very similar to \"The Ugly\" except, of course, the visualization. It displays the same information and data concerning the sums of snowfall accumulation per month, but the visuals are distinctly different. Firstly, the color is much easier on the eyes and not distracting from the data. Secondly, the line thickness makes it easy to see the values correctly and is aided with labels. Lastly, we added a trend line to give the viewers a reference point on what the average sum of snowfall is for all of the months. We believe it adds a nice touch to our visualization and allows for a baseline judgement of the data."

First, it is impossible to determine which color matches to which month, making the image unclear.  Next, the color scheme, which would usually correlate to a warming of temperatures, has to actual meaning, thus further confusing the viewer.  The viewer would be more liekly to view this data as the amount of snow at different temperatures, rather than a viewing of the amount of snow seen in each month."
