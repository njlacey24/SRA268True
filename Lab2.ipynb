The bars to the left show that, on average, the winning teams that year scored less points than the average for the entire data. I think diverging bar charts give this visualization an interesting perspective if you add some color to the bars like I did to emphasize how great the difference was. There were years where the average points scored by the winning teams was well above the dataset average and using diverging bars really helps to emphasize those differences."

I chose these two values specifically because it would create a drastic visualization at the y=x line. There obviously can't be any values below that line because then the other team would have won. I also edited the colors non-stepped because I didn't want to group any categories together. I wanted to show the gradient from a team losing by a little (green) to teams losing by a significant margin (red). I think this also help highlights team efforts by showing that just because a winning team scored a lot of points doesn't mean that the winning team dominated the losing team."
